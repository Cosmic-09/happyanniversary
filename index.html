        <h3>Happy Anniversary</h3>
        <p>
            It's already been 8 months with you, and honestly, these have been some of the best moments of my life. Every day with you feels special in its own way—the laughs, the talks, even the small silly things. You've become such an important part of my life without me even realizing when it happened.
        </p>

        <p>
            I'm grateful for you, for us, and for everything we've shared so far. I don't know what the future holds, but one thing I'm sure of is that I want it with you. Let's stay the same, grow together, and keep choosing each other—always.
